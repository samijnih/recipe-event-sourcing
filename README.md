[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/samijnih/recipe-event-sourcing.svg?style=flat-square)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/samijnih/recipe-event-sourcing)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to compare how much time it takes to implement Event Sourcing using one of these libraries:
- [Event Sauce](https://eventsauce.io/)
- [Broadway](https://github.com/broadway/broadway)
- [Prooph](https://getprooph.org/)

The default branch (main) contains EventSauce by default.

Others implementations could be found on these branches (when done):
- broadway
- prooph
